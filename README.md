## Overview

This project involves the development of a predictive maintenance model designed to forecast hardware failures. During my internship, I faced significant challenges but am proud of the results achieved.

## Features

- **Predictive Model**: Utilizes key features such as air temperature, process temperature, tool wear, and torque to predict hardware failure likelihood and type. ![Model](https://img.shields.io/badge/Model-Predictive%20Model-blue)
- **Training and Testing**: The model was trained and tested rigorously to ensure accuracy. ![Testing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Testing-Rigorous%20Testing-yellow)
- **Web Integration**: Successfully connected the model to a website for real-time predictions. ![Web Integration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Web%20Integration-Real%20Time%20Predictions-orange)

## Dataset

The model uses data from the [Kaggle Predictive Maintenance Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification). ![Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dataset-Kaggle-blue)

## Usage

1. Ensure the web server is running.
2. Access the web interface to input data and view predictions.
